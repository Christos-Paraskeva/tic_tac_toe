```
As a player
So that I can play against a friend
I would like the game require two players

As a player
So that that we can both make a move
I would like us to each take turns to make a move

As a player
So that I can select a valid space
I would like only be able to move to empty fields

As a player
So that my opponent can has their move
I would like the turn to end once I have claimed a field

As a player
So that I know I have won or loss
I would like to be alerted of the win or loss all fields in
a row, column or diagonal have been claimed

As a player
So that I can start a new game
I would like the game to end if a player wins

As a player
So that I know if it's a tie
I would like the game to end when all fields are taken
